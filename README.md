### ‚Äî _APIs:_
The developed API is implemented according to the REST API design.

- **[Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)**
  - You can import a [JSON-file](https://github.com/avito-tech/tech-internship/blob/main/Tech%20Internships/Backend/Backend-trainee-assignment-winter-2025/schema.json) from the API into Postman to run queries.

### ‚Äî _Further development:_
1. Integrate Swagger and Swagger UI
2. Implement RefreshToken and a handle to refresh AccessToken
3. Realize CI/CD pipelines for internet deployment

### ‚Äî _Q&A:_
- Which tests should I choose for the scenarios, integration or E2E?
  - I chose integration ones as they are simpler and cheaper.
- Which libraries/packages to choose?
  - Did a comparative analysis between the popular ones, and chose the best ones. For example, for the server - Gin: because, easier to implement and wanted something new).
- What validations should I do for username, for example?
  - Made less standardized requirements for incoming fields.
